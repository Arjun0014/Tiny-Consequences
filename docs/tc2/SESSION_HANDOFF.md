# TC2 Session handoff

## Session 2 (5 Oct 2026) — in progress (see PROGRESS.md CURRENT STATE)

### Exact state
- Session 2 commits since the last checkpoint (newest last): 11fb029 stores free the pages of sparse ids (D2-055), DECISIONS
  D2-053/054, tools `follow` and fire tallies · 3db0273 the household's own work and warmth (D2-056) and no float arithmetic in
  the core (D2-057; `tc2/tools/floatcheck` runs before the headless tests).
- Phases: F0 done, F1 closed, F2 closed, F3 in progress. **F3 is not closed**: following people showed grown people idle 7-9 hours
  a day outside sowing and harvest (`timeuse`); D2-056 gave them meals, water, wood for the hearths and made houses matter
  (warmth); the slack's real work is still missing (see Next steps 1). 111 headless tests green.
- Determinism: Mono (editor) equals dotnet again from generation through day 3 (`hashtest --parts`); the Web build (IL2CPP) has not
  been rebuilt since D2-056/057 - rebuild and run `webtest.mjs` on both paths at the next milestone.
- Nothing running. Uncommitted legacy TC1 work may exist in the tree and is NOT ours: `game/html/engine_template.html` and
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-227). Never stage them in [tc2] commits.

### How to run things
| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Core tests (fast) | `node tc2/scripts/headless.mjs test [--filter X]` (~110 s for all 101) |
| A world run with history | `node tc2/scripts/headless.mjs run --seed 42 --years 30 --report-days 480 --tier 3 [--out DIR] [--why] [--profile] [--coarse]` |
| Villages over time | `run --seed 42 --years 200 --report-days 2400 --tier 9 --coarse --places --profile` (per village: people, fields, granary, ration, wild grounds, **stock and pasture** offered/wanted, herds; then the stock line, **deaths by kind and cause**, the profile with `daily.*` parts) |
| Planet over time | `planet --seed 42 --years 3000 --every 9600 --nopeople --coarse [--tect] [--volc] [--eco] [--csv F] [--ecocsv F] [--map DIR]` (each report line ends with elapsed seconds and the number of kinds) |
| 10,000-year runs | copy `tc2/headless/app/bin/Release/net8.0` to the scratchpad, then `dotnet <copy>/tc2.dll planet --seed 42 --years 10000 --every 4800 --coarse --nopeople --tect --volc --eco --csv tc2/out/f1/run_42X.csv --ecocsv tc2/out/f1/eco_42X.csv > tc2/out/f1/run_42X.txt` (~22-25 min each) |
| Climate alone (fast) | `node tc2/scripts/headless.mjs climate --seed 42 --years 4000 --every 200 [--co2 560]` |
| People diagnostics | `node tc2/scripts/headless.mjs probe --seed 42 --days 4 --rows 30` |
| Benchmarks | `node tc2/scripts/headless.mjs bench [--name queue|dmath|poc|save] [--coarse]` |
| Cross-runtime probe | `node tc2/scripts/headless.mjs hashtest`; `node tc2/scripts/unity.mjs hashtest` |
| Unity configure / tests | `node tc2/scripts/unity.mjs configure` / `node tc2/scripts/unity.mjs test` |
| **Look-dev screenshots** | `node tc2/scripts/unity.mjs shots --tag T [--views orbit,region,village,close,low,volcano,...,coast,seals] [--hour 8] [--days D] [--seed N] [--erupt VEI] [--quake M] [--storm WIND]` -> `tc2/out/shots/T/*.png` |
| Asset kit | `"C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 5.2/blender.exe" -b --factory-startup --python tc2/art/kit.py -- --out unity/TinyConsequences2/Assets/TC2/Game/Resources/TC2Models [--preview tc2/out/kit]` |
| Web build / serve / test | `node tc2/scripts/unity.mjs build-web [--webgl2]` (5-9 min) · `node tc2/scripts/serve.mjs` · `node tc2/scripts/webtest.mjs --tag T [--webgl2]` |
| URL params | `?fresh=1`, `?seed=N`, `?speed=I`, `?absence=24h`, `?view=close|village|region`, `?gfx=webgl2` |

### Important paths
- Unity editor 6000.6.4f1: `C:/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.6.4f1/Editor/Unity.exe`; bundled dotnet in `.../Editor/Data/DotNetSdk/dotnet.exe`.
- Core: `unity/TinyConsequences2/Assets/TC2/Core/{Foundation,Scheduling,Simulation,Planet,Places,Agents,History,Persistence,Diagnostics,Worldgen}`;
  places: `Places/{Settlement,SettlementSystem,WildFood,Construction,Sites,Migration,Herds,Livestock}.cs`.
- Game view: `Game/View/{WorldObjectsView,WildlifeView,SeaLifeView,...}.cs`; kit models `Game/Resources/TC2Models/*.fbx` (from `tc2/art/kit.py`).
- Tests: `Tests/Core/*Tests.cs` (WildFood 11, Migration 5, Livestock 11, ...); `TestWorlds.Audit` checks people, queues and livestock lists.
- CC0 Quaternius farm animals (Blend/FBX) in `assets/3d-models/animals_quaternius/` (not used yet: the kit's own quadrupeds keep one style).

### Pitfalls found (session 2 additions; session 1's list still applies - see git history of this file)
- Grep build output for `error MSB` too: a locked DLL fails the copy with no `error CS`.
- A long headless run on the repo DLL locks it: run long jobs from a scratch copy.
- `planet --nopeople` used to found one village (`Math.Max(1, cfg.Settlements)`): runs before 6b0903d labelled planet-only may have people.
- Lookups that walk a whole store per agent-day (all herds, all settlements) are invisible at 6 villages and dominate at 30:
  index per village; profile a 200-300-year coarse run (`--profile`, `daily.*` parts) after adding any per-day lookup.
- `CellsWithin` keeps its answers per (cell, range) (the grid never changes); results are the same list in the same order.
- The village's day (`SettlementSystem.Daily`) runs at local midnight: `P.Temp` then is the night's (diurnal swing 5 C on land).
  Use `PlanetSystems.DayMean(c, PlanetSystems.Season(t))` for a day's mean.
- A test's premise can be undone by the world before the mechanism runs (hunters brought food home before the herd's day):
  call the system step directly when the test is about that step.
- A planet step (tectonic, evolution) can fall inside any test's hour: filter history checks by the kinds under test.
- Heredocs with apostrophes break: patch scripts go in `scratchpad/patch_*.py` written with the Write tool.
- `headless.mjs test --filter A|B` matches nothing (no alternation): run the filters one by one.
- Kit re-exports touch every FBX (new timestamps): restore the unchanged ones with
  `git diff --name-only -- .../TC2Models/ | xargs -r git checkout --` before committing; a glob also catches new untracked files.
- Any rule the simulation and the view must share (a herd's ground, the frost that pens the animals, which seals show) lives
  in Core or one static helper both call - never two copies.
- Test mechanisms, not demography: "mostly children herd" failed because only 1 of 19 households had a child of 8-15.
- **No float arithmetic in TC2.Core** (D2-057): `a + b` on two floats rounds differently under Mono; write `(double)a + b` and cast
  to float only when storing. `headless.mjs test` runs `tc2/tools/floatcheck` first and fails on any.
- A store whose ids come from a shared counter (process ids: herds, parties, fires, storms) is sparse: check `PagesHeld` and the
  cost of a pass over it at scale (D2-055).
- A new daily need (meals, water, fuel) changes what a "stocked" premise means in old tests: restate the premise (keep the store
  stocked), do not loosen the mechanism (D2-056).

### Next steps
1. **F3's believable day** (D2-056 open): crafts and the making and mending of clothes and gear in the slack hours (textiles took
   farming households hours every day; clothes worn thin make the cold bite sooner), hay against the animals' winter (the view's
   haystacks to come from it), weeding labour, and minding infants and toddlers (07 §2's carer). Measure with `timeuse` across
   the year (sowing, growing, harvest, winter) and `follow`; then close F3.
2. **Offline catch-up at scale**: a saturated world (~14,000 people) costs ~1 s a world year headless (fires no longer 35 % of it
   since D2-055: measure again) - "a day away" (a century) would take minutes in the browser. Cheaper person-days, a cohort
   resolution for deep time, or the Living span adapting to the world's size; measure the Web catch-up from a mature save.
3. **The sea's calibration**: the fish fields hold ~1 % of real biomass, so the miniature holds ~10-20 seals (D2-053 found);
   wide-ranging hunters should hunt over their range; 10,000-year reruns.
4. **Famine in the full world**: ~1 % of the people die of hunger each year once the land is full - relief, exchange and storage
   between villages (F5).
5. WebGL2's first-entry stall (a traced shader-variant collection warmed progressively); look backlog: coast shapes off the
   cell grid, gardens, orbit detail, smoke from huts and camps.
